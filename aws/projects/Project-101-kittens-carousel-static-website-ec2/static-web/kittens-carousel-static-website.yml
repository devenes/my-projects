  Kittens Carousel Static Website will be 
  deployed on Amazon Linux 2 
  (ami-0a8b4cd432b1c3063) EC2 Instance with 
  custom security group which allows http 
  connections on port 80 and ssh port 22 from 
  anywhere. Kittens Carousel Static Website 
  is downloaded from my Public Github repository,
  then deployed on Apache Web Server.
